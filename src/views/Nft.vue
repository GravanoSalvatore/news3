         <strong class="text-center"> Top 10 NFT Marketplaces You Should Know</strong>
        </h3>

        <p>NFTs are special tokens that represent one-of-a-kind digital assets, such as artwork or media, on the blockchain. An NFT is like a permanent digital proof that shows you own something, whether itâ€™s a digital item or a physical object. It guarantees the authenticity and ownership of the asset.
  
  Though it started off in 2014, it became a buzzword in the world in the year of 2017. As the development of NFTs continues gaining momentum, new NFT marketplaces have emerged as top platforms for trading NFTs. 
  
  In the year 2023, the NFT trend is expected to boom as a lot of new marketplaces are opening. If someone wants to be part of the NFT culture, then he/she must access the NFT marketplaces as their gateway to buy or sell digital assets. 
  
  </p>
         <p>As of today, there are more than dozens of NFT marketplaces, and a lot of them are focused on specific niches. If you are new to the world of NFTs, then you might be in a dilemma on what to consider before deciding which NFT marketplace you should count on for your purchase or sell. To make it easy for you to decide, here are the top NFT marketplaces for you to count on.</p>
  
  
         <h2 class="blog-post-title">What Are NFT Marketplaces? How Do They Work?</h2>
         <img class="bd-placeholder-img card-img-top" width="100%" height="500" :src="baner2" role="img" aria-label="Placeholder: Thumbnail" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice" focusable="false">
            
         <p>Before you get along with the best NFT marketplaces, first get an idea of what these platforms actually are:
  
  An NFT marketplace is a digital platform that can be used for buying or selling NFTs. Moreover, these platforms also allow people to store or display their NFTs and put them up for sale to others. The sellers can exchange their collections for money or cryptocurrency.</p>
         <p>Some of the top NFT platforms enable you to mint your NFTs over the platform. The platforms charge a fee for handling the transfer of NFTs from one party to another. Every NFT marketplace has a specific set of rules, features, and SOPs on how they operate. The permitted blockchains, payment options, types of NFTs, fees, and other such rules will vary from one marketplace to another.</p>
  
  <h2 class="blog-post-title">Working on NFT Marketplaces</h2>
         
  <p>The first thing you need to use NFT marketplaces is your own account on a marketplace platform. Once you have created an account on the NFT marketplace, you can browse through all the available listings of NFTs on sale. You can also choose the desired payment methods to buy the NFTs you want on the platform. Some of the marketplaces even ask you to link your crypto wallet to pay with cryptocurrency. But most of the platforms allow you to use credit cards for payments.
  
  Some platforms allow you to purchase NFTs at fixed prices, while others want you to bid in auctions. Upon completing the transaction, the NFT marketplace will record the same over blockchain to show the transfer of ownership for the specific digital asset or NFT.</p>
  
  
  <p>Some of the NFT statistics that have scaled the trend for these marketplaces to boom are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The sales volume for the NFTs totalled up to $24.9 billion in the year 2021. It was recorded as a humongous rise from roughly $94.9 million in the year 2020.</li>
    <li>The number of wallets that were registered for trading NFTs was 545,000 in 2020. But by the year 2021, this count increased to 28.6 million. It shows the thriving demands of NFTs in this decade.</li>
    <li>The NFT market is expected to boom and generate a market size of around $80 billion by the year 2025.
  </li>
  </ul>
